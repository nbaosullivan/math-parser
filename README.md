# Math Parser Drupal 8 Module
This Drupal 8 module provides a mathematical string parser service, field type, and configurable field formatter.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Working Drupal 8 instance
- Install module dependencies.
 `composer require drupal/graphql_views` and install within Drupal (will also install graphql).

**Module Dependencies**
- [graphql](https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql) 
- [graphql_views](https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql_views)
### Installing
 
1. Include this module in the `/modules` folder of a Drupal 8 instance.
2. Navigate into `js/app` and run `npm install` then `npm run build`
3. Navigate to `/admin/modules` and, under the Field Types category, Install `Math Parser` and `Math Parser Example`. 
This will create an example content type called `Maths quiz` and a view called `Math Parser Example`.
4. Create a piece of Maths quiz content, demonstrated below.

## Overiew
### Field formatter widget options

- `React` displays the formulas as an interactive React quiz. This only work when using the Math Parser field type.
- `Twig` which will render without loading the React javascript and display it in the following format `{{formula}} = {{result}}`. This formatter widget option can also work on Text (plain) field types. 
- `Answer only` which will render just the answer. This is used within the GraphQL view to return only the answer when checking if the user input is correct. This formatter widget option can also work on Text (plain) field types.

By default, the field formatter will display the formulas in an interactive quiz. Enter a number and hit enter.

### Drupal Service

This module provides the MathParser service, found in `src/Services/MathParser.php`.
You can access this like any other Drupal service, see the example below.

```
      $string = '2+2';  
      $math_parser = \Drupal::Service('math_parser.math_parser');
      $parsed_value = $math_parser->calculate($string);
```

### React
When using the `React` widget option for the field formatter, a progressively decoupled React app using webpack is included within the Math Parser field template. 
This uses GraphQL to retrieve the formula answer when a user enters there answer, and after three attempts or a correct answer, the user is give the next formula. 

*Please note that currently the React requests using GraphQL won't work without the `Math Parser Example` module enabled as the GraphQL query depends on a specific view that references fields that are also generated upon installation of the example module.* 
 
## Running the tests
You may need to run `composer run-script drupal-phpunit-upgrade` if PHPUnit testing framework is out of date.

Module unit tests can be found in `tests/src/Unit` and run using PHPUnit.
 
**Recommended:** create phpunit.xml.dist (using config similar to the below example in root of project and run `./vendor/bin/phpunit`
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<phpunit bootstrap="core/tests/bootstrap.php" colors="true">
  <testsuites>
    <testsuite name="unit">
      <directory>modules/custom/math_parser/tests</directory>
    </testsuite>
  </testsuites>
</phpunit>
```

Please note: the react field formatter is dependent on the view math_parser_answer provided with this module
select Widget Type Answer only and uncheck Display all value in the same row
The example view provided with this module only work for field_math_questions
Make sure dev composer dependecies are installed `composer install`
In project root run `./vendor/bin/phpunit`
